/**
 * JSch {@link HostKeyRepository} backed by the {@code host_key} table - Bastillion's
 * known_hosts.
 * <p>
 * Every SSH session used to be opened with {@code StrictHostKeyChecking=no}, which does not
 * mean "warn" - it means the key a host presents is never compared to anything. A bastion is
 * the worst place for that: it hands the host the application private key, and on an
 * authentication fallback the user's own password or key passphrase, so anything that can
 * answer on a managed system's address once can collect credentials for it.
 * <p>
 * Verification mode comes from the {@code hostKeyVerification} property:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code accept-new} (default) - record the key the first time a host is seen and
 *       trust it, then refuse to connect if that host ever presents a different one. Mirrors
 *       OpenSSH's own accept-new. Chosen as the default because it needs no action from an
 *       operator upgrading an existing install, while still closing the case that actually
 *       matters: a key that changes under you.</li>
 *   <li>{@code strict} - additionally require a manager to approve each newly seen host key
 *       before the first connection to it is allowed.</li>
 *   <li>{@code off} - no verification (the pre-6.0.0 behavior).</li>
 * </ul>
